# CNN_Autoencoder
CNN to get denoised data from noisy data.

1. Generate a CNN model in which the input is a noisy number and the output is a denoised number. 
2. MNIST dataset. 
3. Use Gaussian distribution to add noise to the input. 
4. Plot the training & validation loss. 
5. Build a classifier based on the trained Autoencoder.
